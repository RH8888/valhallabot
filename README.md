## üì¶ Installation Guide

To get ValhallaBot up and running, follow these steps. Docker and Docker Compose are the recommended installation methods.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

*   **Git:** For cloning the repository.
*   **Docker:** [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
*   **Docker Compose:** [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) (usually included with Docker Desktop)

### Step-by-Step Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    Start by cloning the ValhallaBot repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/valhallabot/valhallabot.git
    cd valhallabot
    ```

2.  **Environment Configuration:**
    Create your environment file by copying the example and filling in your specific details (e.g., bot tokens, API keys, database credentials).

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Edit the newly created `.env` file with your preferred text editor:
    ```
    # Example .env content
    BOT_TOKEN=YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE
    MYSQL_HOST=db
    MYSQL_USER=valhalla_user
    MYSQL_PASSWORD=your_mysql_password
    MYSQL_DATABASE=valhalla_db
    # ... other variables
    ```

3.  **Build and Run with Docker Compose:**
    Use Docker Compose to build the necessary images and start all services defined in `docker-compose.yml`. This will set up the bot, API services, and any required databases (like MySQL).

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```
    *   `--build`: Rebuilds images even if they exist.
    *   `-d`: Runs the containers in detached mode (in the background).

4.  **Verify Installation:**
    You can check the logs to ensure all services are running correctly:

    ```bash
    docker-compose logs -f
    ```
    Look for messages indicating successful startup of `bot.py` and `app.py`.

### Manual Python Installation (Alternative)

If you prefer to run the bot without Docker, you can set up the Python environment manually.

1.  **Install Python Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Run the Bot:**

    ```bash
    python bot.py
    ```
    *Note: This method requires manual setup of any external services (like MySQL) and environment variables.*


## üöÄ Usage Examples

Once ValhallaBot is running, it will automatically connect to your configured platform.

### Basic Bot Interaction

Interact with the bot using its defined commands. For example, if it's a Discord bot:

```
/help
/status
/info
```

*Replace with actual bot commands once implemented.*

### Accessing the API

If the `api` service is exposed, you can interact with it via HTTP requests.

```bash
# Example API call (replace with actual endpoint)
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/status
```

### Configuration Options

Most configuration is handled via the `.env` file. A full list of configurable variables will be available in the `.env.example` file.

| Variable Name     | Description                                     | Default Value |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------------------------- | :------------ |
| `BOT_TOKEN`       | Your bot's authentication token.                | `None`        |
| `MYSQL_HOST`      | Hostname for the MySQL database.                | `db`          |
| `MYSQL_USER`      | Username for MySQL access.                      | `valhalla_user` |
| `MYSQL_PASSWORD`  | Password for MySQL access.                      | `your_mysql_password` |
| `MYSQL_DATABASE`  | Database name to connect to.                    | `valhalla_db` |
| `API_PORT`        | Port for the API service.                       | `8000`        |
| `DEBUG_MODE`      | Enable/disable debug logging.                   | `False`       |
